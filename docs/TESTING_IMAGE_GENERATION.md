# 🧪 Testing Grok Image Generation

## Issue Found & Fixed

### ❌ **Original Problem:**
- Screenshots were uploaded to Pinata successfully
- But Grok images were NOT being generated
- The image generation API call was failing silently

### 🔧 **Root Cause:**
- Used incorrect model name: `'grok-vision-beta'` ❌
- Should have been: `'grok-2-image'` ✅
- Also included unsupported `size` parameter

### ✅ **Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
body: JSON.stringify({
  prompt: imagePrompt,
  model: 'grok-vision-beta', // ❌ Wrong model name
  n: 1,
  size: '1024x1024', // ❌ Not supported
  response_format: 'url',
})

// AFTER (Correct):
body: JSON.stringify({
  model: 'grok-2-image', // ✅ Correct model
  prompt: imagePrompt,
  n: 1,
  response_format: 'url', // ✅ Clean parameters
})
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Generate a Game**
1. Open `http://localhost:3002` or your Vercel deployment
2. Connect your wallet
3. Pay $0.20 USDC
4. Enter a game prompt:
   ```
   A space shooter where you dodge asteroids and collect power-ups
   ```
5. Click "Generate Game"

### **Step 2: Watch the Console Logs**

When the NFT minting starts, you should see:

```
🎨 [NFT Service] Starting NFT minting flow...
🎨 [NFT Service] Step 1: Generating custom NFT image with Grok AI...
📝 [Image Generation] Game prompt: A space shooter...

📤 [NFT Service] Step 2: Uploading NFT image to IPFS...
✅ [NFT Service] NFT image uploaded: ipfs://...
```

### **Step 3: Check Pinata**

Go to your Pinata dashboard:
- You should see TWO images uploaded (not just one):
  1. **Original screenshot** (fallback, uploaded first)
  2. **Grok-generated NFT image** (the actual NFT image)

### **Step 4: Verify NFT**

Once minted:
1. Click "View on BaseScan"
2. Look at the NFT metadata
3. The image should be the Grok-generated artwork, featuring:
   - "GAMEFORGE" branding at top
   - Your game screenshot in the center
   - Holographic borders and neon effects
   - Cyberpunk aesthetic

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Still seeing plain screenshots on Pinata**

Check the console for error messages:

**Error 1: API Key Issue**
```
❌ [Image Generation] API key not configured
```
**Solution**: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GROK_API_KEY` to your `.env.local`

**Error 2: Model Not Found**
```
❌ [Image Generation] Grok API error: 404
```
**Solution**: Already fixed! Model name corrected to `grok-2-image`

**Error 3: Invalid Response**
```
❌ [Image Generation] Invalid response format: {...}
```
**Solution**: Check the logged response structure and update parsing logic

**Error 4: Rate Limit**
```
❌ [Image Generation] Grok API error: 429
```
**Solution**: Wait a moment and try again

### **Issue: Fallback to Screenshot**

If you see:
```
⚠️ [NFT Service] Image generation failed, using original screenshot
```

This means the image generation failed, but the NFT was still minted with the screenshot. Check the error logs above this message.

## 📊 Expected vs Actual

### **Before Fix:**
```
Pinata Files:
- game-screenshot-123456.png ✅ (screenshot uploaded)
- [No Grok image] ❌ (generation failed)

Console:
- ❌ [Image Generation] Grok API error: 404 - Model not found
- ⚠️ [NFT Service] Image generation failed, using original screenshot
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Pinata Files:
- game-screenshot-123456.png ✅ (screenshot uploaded)
- game-nft-123456.png ✅ (Grok-generated image)

Console:
- ✅ [Image Generation] Image generated successfully
- ✅ [NFT Service] Custom NFT image generated successfully!
- ✅ [NFT Service] NFT image uploaded: ipfs://...
```

## 🎯 What to Look For

### **In Browser Console:**
1. `🎨 [NFT Service] Step 1: Generating custom NFT image with Grok AI...`
2. `✅ [Image Generation] Image generated successfully`
3. `✅ [NFT Service] Custom NFT image generated successfully!`

### **On Pinata:**
1. Two image files uploaded
2. Second one should be larger (includes branding and effects)

### **On BaseScan/OpenSea:**
1. NFT image shows GameForge branding
2. Not just a plain screenshot
3. Holographic borders and effects visible

## 🚀 Performance Expectations

- **Image Generation**: 5-10 seconds (Grok AI processing)
- **Download & Convert**: 1-2 seconds
- **IPFS Upload**: 2-3 seconds
- **Total Additional Time**: ~8-15 seconds vs plain screenshot

This is acceptable for premium NFT artwork!

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Test is successful if:**
- ✅ No errors in console during image generation
- ✅ Grok API returns image URL
- ✅ Image downloads successfully
- ✅ Grok-generated image uploaded to Pinata
- ✅ NFT minted with Grok image (not screenshot)
- ✅ NFT displays GameForge branding on BaseScan
